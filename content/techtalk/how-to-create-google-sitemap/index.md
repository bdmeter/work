Today we will learn how to create Google Sitemap. Google Sitemap is very important because you need to do page ranking with Google Sitemap. Sitemap is a type of mapping where there will be links to all the pages of your website. You can easily create a sitemap on the Linux operating system.

`sudo apt-get install php-curl`

3. Then enter the [Sitemap-Generator-Crawler] folder. Then open the terminal window here.

4. Right click on the mouse [Open in Terminal]

5. Then type in the following command terminal, press [Enter]

`php sitemap.php file = sitemap.xml site = https: //example.com`

Here [example.com] means your website url.

6. Then you will see that sitemap.xml has been generated in your folder.

7. Now upload the [sitemap.xml] file to your website public directory.

8. Then you submit /sitemap.xml to Google [google webmaster / search console].

9. You will link the sitemap file to your robot.txt file so that Google can crawl the sitemap.

`Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml`

10. Remember that you can create a sitemap once by downloading a github. Every new domain sitemap requires a new GitHub clone command every time [https://github.com/knyzorg/Sitemap-Generator-Crawler.git]

__Also in very shortcut system you can create sitemap with npm. Follow the reduction below.__
