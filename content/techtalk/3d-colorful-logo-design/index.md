## 3D colorful logo design using adobe illustrator cc 2020

Welcome to Adobe illustrator course cc 2020. And in this video I will be teaching you how you can create colorful logo. Now it’s super easy to do and let’s see how that’s done.

The first thing we have to do is to create on your document. So the document that I wouldn’t be using for district auditor is this custom sized document which is called in by a thousand pixels. And I repeat be naming this store reading column for logo. So in case if you want to use the same size document as I am you can easily just add the values in the rich and the height options right here. Or if you feel like you can use some outdoor size documents which are already being provided by Adobe Illustrator and you just click on tiered. OK.
