The country has announced to extend the holiday once again till January 16. According to the Ministry of Education on Friday, all educational institutions, schools, colleges, universities and national universities will remain closed till January 16. Until December 17, all educational institutions in the country were closed except Qawmi Madrasa.

To curb the spread of corona virus in Bangladesh, all educational institutions were closed from March 17 and all educational institutions were closed till December 17.

Today, in the context of a one-point discussion with the Ministry of Education, the closure period was again extended to January 16, 2021.

This is a very important initiative of our country's Ministry of Education during the Corona epidemic. With the efforts of all of us, we will be able to prevent the Karona epidemic, InshaAllah.

We hope that by January Bangladesh will be able to announce a call for corona vaccine and that the government will take action in the national interest until we get vaccinated.
