The Bieber Federal Advisory Panel has recommended 75-year-olds and older workers, such as firefighters, teachers and grocery store workers, to take the next step in the CVID-19 vaccine.

According to the Department of Disease Control and Prevention, about 556,000 Americans have been given initial shots through the vaccination program that began last week.

Pfizer Inc. And the COVID-19 vaccine, developed by Bionetech in Germany, is already being distributed. Moderna Inc. Its vaccine was approved last week and distributed last Sunday.

The panel voted last Sunday to decide who should be the next step, and decided by vote that there should be about 20 million people aged 75 or older, as well as certain front-line staff of about 30 million.  
Emergency personnel include firefighters and police; Teachers and school staff; Those working in the food, agriculture and manufacturing sectors; Correctional staff; U.S. Postal Service employees; Public transport workers; And grocery store workers, their risk of infection is very high because they need regular contact with other people.

We hope that Bangladesh has a lot to learn from here. In order to avoid any kind of corruption, the work is done through panel voting in America which is completely transparent. Serious / more urgent matters are considered with utmost importance to get the job done. There are government transparent executive committees for supervision which are very perfect in their work and are conducted transparently by the high supervision committee.
