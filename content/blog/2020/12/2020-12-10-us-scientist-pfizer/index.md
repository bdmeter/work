U.S. experts on Thursday called on a panel of U.S. government advisers to decide whether to support the large-scale use of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to combat the outbreak of nearly 300,000 American corona deaths.

## Pfizer vaccine for corona prevention

The meeting of Food and Drug Administration advisers will present the potential hurdles from the beginning to the end of the largest immunization program in U.S. history. Vaccination activities could begin in a few days, depending on how quickly the FDA signs the panel's recommendations.

The FDA panel has all the powers here and will conduct activities based on its views. During the day-long session, there was considerable debate as to how safe and effective the vaccine would be for emergency use, and the data they had.

The FDA broadcast the meeting via YouTube and recorded thousands of views. "The American people demand a rigorous, comprehensive and independent review of the arguments in favor of the vaccine, and demand accurate proof of it," said Dr. Doran Fink of the FDA.


### Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine

Later this month, the FDA is expected to rule on another vaccine, developed by Modarna and the National Institutes of Health, which has proven to be as protective as Pfizer. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca are in the pipeline.

Pfizer and Modern's primary supplies will be primarily limited and reserved for healthcare workers and nursing home patients, as well as conducting activities extensively on demand in coordination with other vulnerable staff.

The corona virus continues in most parts of the world, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in the United States, including about 290,000. British officials had a warning that people with a history of severe allergies should not be vaccinated. Authorities are investigating two reactions when Britain was the first country in the West to launch a mass vaccine against the deadly disease last Tuesday.
