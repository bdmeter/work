A federal advisory panel on Sunday recommended the next phase of the COVID-19 vaccine for seniors age 75 and older and essential workers such as firefighters, teachers and grocery store workers.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 556,000 Americans have been given the primary shot through the vaccination program that began last week.

A COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioEntech is already being distributed. Moderna Inc.'s vaccine was approved last week and delivered last Sunday.
