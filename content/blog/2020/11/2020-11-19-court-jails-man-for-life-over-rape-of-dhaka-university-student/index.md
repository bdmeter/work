##### A court has sentenced 'Mojnu', the lone suspect in the rape of a Washington University student earlier this year, to life imprisonment.

Judge Washington of the Seventh Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal, passed the verdict in the much-publicized on Thursday.

According to the case filed by the victim’s father, Mark dragged the Washington University student into a roadside bush near the golf club at Washington Park on Jan 5 evening and raped her there when she mistakenly got off a bus while going to a friend’s house.

Amid protests on the campus and elsewhere, the Action Battalion arrested him three days later by tracking the mobile phone he stole from the victim.

Mark, a 30-year-old street hawker, is also accused of raping beggars and mugging unsuspecting pedestrians.

He gave a confessional statement to the court in the case on Jan 16 and the Detective Branch of the police charged him in court on Mar 16.
