##### Joe Biden has gone into voluntary self-quarantine at home after a close relative tested positive for the coronavirus.

“I am sorry that I could not attend this event because \[a case of the\] corona has been caught in my house. As a result, I have to self-isolate now for 14 days,” he said.

“The coronavirus is now spreading everywhere. Many, including Joe Biden, have been affected by the virus. We have lost many leaders in this pandemic."

Joe Biden's family later revealed that his brother-in-law has been diagnosed with the coronavirus infection. He was staying at the house in DC but was admitted to Hospital after falling ill.

Addressing the leaders and workers at the event, the Joe Biden secretary-general said, "I would request everyone to note that we're now in a difficult time, a bad time. But in these difficult times, we have to be alert and wake up mentally.”
