## What are Conflict Minerals?

![](images/conflict-minerals.png)

**[Conflict Minerals](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Conflict_minerals_curse_image_in_Congo.png)** refer to raw materials that come from a particular part of the world where conflict is occurring and trading of those materials, perpetuates the fighting. Conflict minerals are mined in conditions of armed conflict and human rights abuses, notably in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
  
The most commonly mined conflict minerals are:    
1. Cassiterite (for **Tin**)  
2. Wolframite (for **Tungsten**)  
3. Coltan (for **Tantalum**)  
4. **Gold**   
They are also known altogether as **3TG** (**T**in, **T**ungsten, **T**antalum, **G**old).

**“Resource curse” countries**

**Resource countries** of conflict minerals are accounted for 25-30% of the world’s supply of tantalum and smaller % of other three minerals:

- Angola
- Burundi
- Central African Republic
- Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”)
- Republic of Congo
- Rwanda
- South Sudan
- Tanzania
- Uganda
- Zambia

### Q&As

- What is the population of your country? 
- How does this number correspond to 5,4 million? e.g equals to one state, one province, one city?

Vendor Compliance & Sustainability (VCS)

### Risk Level in Top Products

## US Conflict Minerals Law

[Dodd-Frank](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q59597365) Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010**. **(Section 1502)**

Requires companies to identify where the minerals used in their products came from.

**Dodd Frank has successfully reduced revenue to militias by 65%**

**But 65% of current trade involves smuggling**

## Auditing and Reporting Requirements

Dodd Frank Act contains **2 auditing and reporting requirements:**

1. Independent third party supply chain traceability **audits**
2. **Reporting** of audit information to the public and  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

**Applicability**  
_Companies are required to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC, if:_  

2a. they are required to file reports with the SEC under the_ **_Exchange Act of 1934_**. 

2b. _conflict minerals are_ **_necessary to the functionality or production_** _of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured._ 

Even companies not directly regulated by SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements, because information will run through companies’ entire supply chains.   
![companies’ entire supply chains](images/image-3.png)

## Customer’s expectations

Customer’s supplier factories should be able to prove that their raw materials used to make customer’s products are conflict free.

### Conflict-Free Sourcing

- Provide origin of 3TG with RCOI (Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry)
- Perform Due Diligence and report to customer 

**How?**  
Have an established **products assessment identification process**, to determine which products contain 3TG minerals

Be able to conduct **Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI)**, to determine whether minerals originated in the resource countries (DRC especially) 

Be able to conduct **due diligence & report** to customer about potential risks so they can be assessed and managed appropriately

Factory should have a Conflict Minerals Compliance Program in place to be able to report back to customer, concerning its products compliance.

**Reporting - CFSI**

**The CFSI**:

**Conflict-Free Sourcing  Initiative.**  
  
Founded by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (Gesi).

2 Major activities:

- **Conflict Free Smelter Program (CFSP)**
    - Certifies smelters as producing conflict-free materials
    - Publishes the list of certified smelters online
- **The Conflict Minerals Reporting Template** (CMRT, also referred to as EICC template)
    - Most widely used Conflict Minerals reporting template

**Companies’ disclosure**:  

In 2014 SEC asked , all registered companies to comply with the conflict minerals law:

- 1,300 companies submitted conflict minerals filings to the SEC 
- almost 1,000 of which included a Conflict Minerals Report

In 2015, more and more companies started publicly disclosing their supply chain’s conflict minerals reports.

In 2016…
