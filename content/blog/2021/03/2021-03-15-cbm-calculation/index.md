To work at FedEx global shipping, it's important to learn CBM calculation. Why? Because you need to estimate shipping cost to quote price to customers. This is very much important.

Fedex Shipping Job Guide

To calculate CBM, we first need to know the length, width and height of the carton in cm. If carton measurement is in inch, we have to convert measurement in inch. Simply multiply the length, width and height to find cubic centimeter and divide by 1000000 to find cubic meter (CBM). Please find the formula as follows:

If carton measurement in inches

<table><tbody><tr><td>Length</td><td>Width</td><td>Height</td><td>Formula(Length X Width X Height in CM/1000000)</td><td>CBM/perCtn</td><td>CtnQty</td><td>TotalCBM</td></tr><tr><td>20.5”</td><td>13”</td><td>4.5”</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>52.07 cm(Converted into cm.We know 1 inch=2.54 cm)</td><td>33.02 cm(Converted into cm.We know1 inch=2.54 cm)</td><td>11.43 cm(Converted into cm.We know1 inch=2.54 cm)</td><td>0.019652187</td><td>0.01965</td><td>3000</td><td>58.96</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Note:**

\*\*Why 1000000?

Ans: Length x Width x Height (in cm)= CUBIC CM. We have to convert it into CUBIC METER. We know 1 meter=100cm. So, 100 x 100 x 100=1000000. That is, 1000000 CUBIC CM=1 CUBIC METER.
