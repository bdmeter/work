## Classification of the methods for dyeing of P/C blend

### Exhaust dyeing method or batch dyeing method

This is again classiﬁed in the following three groups- 
1. Two bath dyeing  
2. One bath one step dyeing  
3. One bath two-step dyeing method  

### Thermosol Dyeing method

It is again classiﬁed into two groups- 
1. Continuous dyeing- 
2. Pad batch process (semi-continuous)  
Note-In continuous dyeing process may be single bath or double bath.

### EXHAUST DYEING

__Two bath dyeing__

This is the process in which we have to dye ﬁrst polyester part in the HTHP beam dyeing machine or HTHP jet  
dyeing machine and the cotton part is dyed in the jigger machine. 

__Batch process__

Machine used for dyeing of polyester part- 

1. HTHP Beam dyeing machine( First commercialized HTHP machine)  
2. HTHP jet dyeing machine Machine used for dyeing of cotton part- 

__Jigger dyeing machine__

### MACHINE FOR POLYESTER DYEING

HTHP beam dyeing machine- 

No need to explain the whole process of dying in a beam dyeing machine. Only some important points we will discuss it- 

__Advantages & features:__

Loading and unloading of the fabric are easy and the time of dyeing is short. Dyeing in open width form. Most suitable for those fabrics that might crease, extend or abrade when dyed in machines where the fabric is in motion. Not appropriate for compact fabrics De-aeration is essential to avoid paler-dyed spots. A wetting agent helps to eliminate air bubbles within the fabric roll.

### Recipe used HTHP dyeing

- Disperse dye- X%(depends upon the shade)  
- Dispersing agent-1g/l  
- Sequestering agent-1-2g/l(If required)  
- Defoamers -.5 to 1g/l  
- Leveling agent-.5 to 1 g/l  
- Wetting agent- .5g/l  
- Acetic acid is enough to get ph=5-6Flow of the liquor usually in the in-to-out direction,  
- but it can be reversed. Out-to-in flow can compress  
- the material causing flattening and glazing, particularly  
- on the inner layers.  
- Material stationary and liquor is moving.  
- Batching is very important, during batching tension  
- should be uniform and optimum.

M:L ratio is 1:10 

Both cloth and yarn can be dyed on this machine

### HTHP BEAM DYEING MACHINE-

### Disadvantages of beam dyeing machine-

The fabric of diﬀerent width can not be dyed together on a single beam. The dyed fabric may be displayed moiré eﬀect if it is tightly due to shrinkage. Uneven dyeing may occur if the beam is fully loaded, as the dye liquor has penetrated several layers of fabric.

### JET DYEING MACHINE

### HTHP jet dyeing machine
The jet dyeing machine is an extension of the HPHT winch dyeing machine. Jet dyeing machine developed by  
BURLINGTON Industries and ﬁrst machine developed in 1963 by Gaston country Machine co. of U.S.A **Features:  
**Both material and liquor are moving. Dyeing in rope form. Fabric speed is usually 200-250mt/min The jet dyeing can usually be operated up to 140 0 c under high pressure and having capacity capable of dyeing 100 to 150 kg of fabric at a time.

**Chemicals added**

- Acids  
- Buﬀers  
- Sequestering agent  
- Anticrease agent  
- Defoamers  
- Leveling agent

### DEVELOPMENT IN JET DYEING

MACHINE-

Soft ﬂow jet- slow motion of the fabric. Suitable for knitted fabric Superjet dyeing machine- M:L is 1:1 . Aerodynamic jet dyeing machine. Jet created by a mixture of air + water M:L is 1:1, drain out at a 130c. Multi-nozzle sot ﬂow jet dyeing machine.

### Advantages of jet dyeing machine:

The fabric of two diﬀerent widths can be dyed at a time so that two lots can be combined together for dyeing.  
No special batching device is required for winding the fabric as in beam dyeing. There is no ﬂattening eﬀect or uneven dyeing on the fabric as in beam dyeing.
