## CHAPTER-5

### SET MACHINE FOR OPERATION

Operation sheet

**Introduction:** This operation sheet covers detailed information about safety guard, stitch tension, different stitching according to fabric type and usage of different parts of Single Needle Lock Stitch machine.

**Object:** This operation sheet will be more helpful to do below tasks as well.

- Cleaning of machine and periodic oiling/lubrication
- Usage of different safety guards
- Attachment of different parts of Single Needle Lock Stitch machine

**Cautions:** 

- Carefully connect all kinds of electric connections.
- After switching on the sewing machine, wait 30 second.
- Don’t keep your foot on Paddle during needle attachment.
- Make sure that the motor's free wheel fully stops before needle attachment. Sometimes motors free wheels continue to rotate after switching off.
-  Don’t touch the back of the switch board because electric wire connections can cause danger.
- Keep your hand far from the needle when the switch is on.
- Don’t keep your finger on the thread take up lever after switching on.
- Make sure that the switch is off before the up-down of the machine head.
- Keep your hand/head far from the machine wheel during operation.
- Switch off motor if sewing operation isn’t continuing. This will be helpful to reduce waste of electricity and motor burn due to excess heat generation. 

**Working procedure:** Below working procedure to prepare Single Needle Lockstitch machine for sewing operation:

1. Firstly take your seat with straight body positioning and eye vision direct to the needle.
2. Clean machine with duster cloth or brush.
3. Then, properly apply oil to the machine and check the oil level is mid position between low level and high-level.
4. After that, usage of safety guard in proper positioning (Needle guard and eye guard)
5. Properly check different parts of the machine to set it in the required position.

Set the machine parts as below procedures:

**Needle attachment procedure:** It needs to be more careful to attach a needle because the needle is a tiny and sharp part of the sewing machine. Steps to be followed for needle attachment-

1. Firstly, loose the needle bar screw.
2. Then, insert the needle (shank/round side/flat side) into the needle bar up to end and tight the screw. For a single needle machine, the needles group cut mark will be at the left side. For double needle sewing machine, right needles group cut mark at right side and left needles group cut mark at left side.

Needle threading of sewing machine

**Bobbin and bobbin case:** Stitching is done by two sets of thread, one from a needle and another from a bobbin. Bobbin case is attached with a hook of Feed dog. Bobbin sets inside the bobbin case. 

**Bobbin threading procedure:** Below procedures to be followed for bobbin winding:

 Attach Bobbin into the right sided bobbin winder of the sewing machine.

1. Manually wind the thread from bobbin winder to the bobbin unto 2-3 spin.
2. Press winder spring and bobbin will be filled up by thread.

![Bobbin attachment procedure on sewing machine](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/i8B9rF-NYqrZzx47A8Mf4-k2f3S3JpsoDY8GRkjkoriJf0YsutxCdUAMFLFdo9bJ5MD7AwaxLR7U6RPhMs31YRVfd5F1d-Eo_o1M_FVivQCPJgf26hP3HjaZD8v5yVw0Mg)

Process to attach bobbin in sewing machine

**Bobbin attachment with Bobbin case:** 

1. Hold Bobbin and Bobbin case face to face
2. Insert Bobbin inside the Bobbin case. Be careful that the thread can easily come out from the bobbin hole.

![Bobbin attachment](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/eTVZPeeoNeigfMeurGZX1Ozh2YUQvkY1XLcsZGE3LvqcGiXcGPaFi_WnoQzVG1_0bLFY8VlT7E9dy8jwZyGF4LQg5KAr_K7mDPMnziXIFSkpvh3SYnMQ7YqGiiVD5qaN0g)


**Bobbin case (with bobbin) attachment and remove from machine:** Bobbin case will attach with the hook of Feed dog just below the needle. Bobbin case will attach with the hook by smoother pressing. Bobbin case will be attached with a sound. Imperfect adjustment won’t create any sound. Bobbin case has a spring to remove that case from the sewing machine.

Although this sheet contains preparation of stitch opening, defect identification and sewing quality control, loose thread trimming and training to get prepared for the next step.

**Objective:** You can do the below tasks after completion of these sheets accurately.

- Stitching of different garment parts to keep qualitative and quantitative control. 
- Defects identification and rectification/avoidance. 
- Stitch opening of different parts

**Information:** This information sheet contains the below information:

**Garment parts:** Detail description of different parts of garment given below-

**Cuff:** This part is attached with a full sleeve opening point of long sleeve Shirts/jacket/others decorative garment. Cuff measurements vary according to garment size/style. Button & buttonhole is attached with a cuff. Four cut panels are required for two cuffs.

### Perform sewing in different component

Operation sheet

**Introduction:** This information sheet will provide a detailed description of Polo Shirt’s sewing exercise and unstitching of different components of Polo shirts. This sheet will help you to sew in a corrective way and will ensure quality sewing operation with trimming and prepare for the next sewing operation.

**Objectives:**  Take papers which have drawn curve lines to easier sewing practices.

- Unstitching of different components.
- Stitching of different components with qualitative and quantitative controls.
- Defects identification and elimination.
