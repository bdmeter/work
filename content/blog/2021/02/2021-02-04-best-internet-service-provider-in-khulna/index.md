First, you need to know some information about your internet service provider. In general, we never ask our internet service provider if they have a government-approved internet service provider ISP license available or not. Additionally, your internet service provider needs permission from BTCL if any license holder needs to start an Internet service-providing business. So, when you are going to request your internet service from your local provider, ask them as an approved internet service provider or not, if yes ask them to show their internet service provoking license and BTCL-approved copy that they have legal permission to provide internet service locally. Another thing is if your internet service provider offers networking via fiber optics, this means you have high possibilities to get stable connectivity and less frequency loss during packet transmitting via fiber optics rather than CAT6 cable.
