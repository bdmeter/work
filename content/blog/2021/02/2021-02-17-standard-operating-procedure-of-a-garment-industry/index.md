## Standard operating procedures (SOP) of a garment idustry 

A Standard Operating Procedure or SOP means is structured documentation that provides step-by-step guidelines and instructions on how to do a particular business activity, such as production or record keeping. We need SOP in a company with different operations in different areas.

### Example of business operating procedure manual:

Standard operating procedures or SOP needs to develop as a structured documented office word or pdf file and manual printed copy for management approval. These procedures also need to approve by international verification companies like SGS, Intertek, Bureau Veritas, etc. The motto of developing a standard manual is to implement all standard procedures in every simple step in the factory or workplace. And finally, need to implement and follow all procedures written in the manual Company responsible personnel need to maintain all written SOP. SOP Auditor will verify all standard procedures are maintaining regarding policies and submit monthly or yearly reports to company top management. A standard procedures manual can change from time to time regarding the way of work system and supply chain. Today we will show you a written structured copy of the STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE SOP MANUAL of a small business. By this SOP manual copy, you can understand then how to create your own company written standard operating procedures step-by-step and a systematic way to implement and maintain this.

### Lighting system in sewing floor for machines problem & solution:

There are two Mechanics lights (small lights) in every top of the sewing machine at every line of all floors. One light is green and the other is red. Every Red light is connected with Maintenance rooms nine light. Every sewing floor has nine lines which are connected with the Maintenance rooms nine light. One Maintenance light for one sewing line. If problems occur in a sewing machine at any line, then turn on a light in the Maintenance room. Machine operator will turn on the red light for machine problems and the operator will stop his/her operation (defective machine causes bad quality garments). A light is turned on in the Maintenance room due to the switch on the red light. Mechanics can understand sewing lines problems to see the light and he resolves the machine problem immediately.

Yellow light is only for the Supervisor to resolve the machine's problem or for proper direction. Example: thread cut, needle problem, bad quality garments, cut panel problem, input problem etc. Supervisor will resolve those problems to see the green light. If he is unable to provide a solution, then he will inform Line Chief, PM, GM gradually.

### Operation procedure of Metal Detector machine & broken needle handling in garments manufacturing:

Garment manufacturing is fully connected with sewing machines. Needles are a tiny part of sewing machines. Sometimes the needle is broken during the sewing operation and the broken parts of the needle are lost. Broken parts of the needle inside the garments are a critical issue and claim from the Buyer's side is a compulsory matter for that issue. In that case, the operator must collect the broken needle parts to provide it to the Needle Operator. If he/she is unable to find all the broken needle parts, then use the magnet collected from the needle operator to find all the tiny needle parts. If he/she fails to find it, then she/he must return the magnet to the needle man. After that, he/she needs to collect the N.D.C-08 number form from Needle man and fill-up the form with the Supervisor's signature. Then he/she will take all the garments from the table to the Metal Detector room and check out the garments properly with the signature of the N.D.M operator in N.D.C08 form. If the needle detector machine operator (N.D.M) found any broken needle inside any garments during checking, he (N.D.M) must keep those garments in a requisition box (never give those broken parts to the sewing operator). Without any needle parts inside the garments, the operator must take those garments in line and will start his/her work again.

### 8.4 Air Conditioner Maintenance manual:

Responsible Technician has to present his workstation 10-15 minutes before the office starts. 

Check the noticeable places in the air conditioner like Panel boards, Dyeing lab, Q.C lab, knitting collar, chemical store and administration office etc. 

**Checking procedure:**

1. Ampere checking: 
    - Check the ampere with AVO Clamp meter.
2. Air filter cleaning:
    - Open the front cover of AC’s indoor unit for air filter and fence cleaning.
3. Air cooling checking:
    - Physical checking of air cooling using by hand feels in front of an indoor unit and ampere.
    - Split AC-Gas meter and AVO clamp ampere meter for cooling check and Ampere meter for amperage check.
4. AC schedule servicing:
    - Clean the indoor front cover, air filter and fence
    - Clean Outdoor units like air line and air filters with using water if having too much dirt.
    -  For too much dust in the indoor unit, lock the indoor unit gas line. Then take it to the Maintenance Department for clean air and water. Again attach the indoor unit and check joint leakages slowly opening the gas line. For any leakage repairing is required. Otherwise recharge required gases for starting AC. Finally check the ampere and gas pressure.

**Major problems of AC:**

AC’s major problems are-

1. Steiner filter block
2. Capillary block
3. Compressor change

Solutions given below:

1. Steiner filter block:

Due to the Steiner filter block, the gas meter shows zero reading. Hold down the gas meter for a certain time to understand the filter blockage because gas pressure is increasing gradually. Firstly I need to release the gases from the Steiner filter and take it to the outdoor shop. Then wash the pipe line of the Steiner filter with Octane or air pressure after opening the pipe line from the filter by welding. After attachment, turn off the suction and discharge line in the outdoor unit. Then check the leakages in every joint area with sufficient air pressure. For any leakages, need to be repaired. Otherwise release the air pressure to make it vacuum. Then set up an outdoor unit and again check the leakage in the suction and discharge joint with air pressure. Repairing needed for any leakage. Otherwise recharge gases in vacuum. Then turn on the AC with Ampere and Gas pressure checking.

2. Capillary block problem:

Capillary tube is a narrow pipe that circulates a certain amount of gases at a required speed. Compressors oil or dust creates blocks into the tube. In that case, open the tube by gas welding. Then clean the tube by air pressure or Octane and attach the tube in the required place. Finally set the outdoor unit and check the AC in running condition.

3. Compressor change: 

Firstly, open the outdoor unit to check AC without gas pressure. If AC isn’t running, then open the compressor by gas welding and cleaning out the pipe. After that attach a new compressor and a new Steiner filter. Then attach an outdoor unit with necessary checking. Finally check AC with required gas pressure.

4. Oil from discharge line:

Sometimes oil came out from the discharge pipe. Gas flow is required to clean the discharge pipe and attach it in the right place. Finally check AC in running condition.

On the other hand, indoor and outdoor board, fan and capacitor problems can occur. Due to these problems, repairing or changing is required.

**AC gas pressure:**

60-65 PSI gas pressure is required during running. Gas pressure depends on AC’s Ampere consumption.

### 9.2 Electric supply accuracy assessment manual:

1. Every floors electricity supply level follow up procedure:

- Firstly, the generator generates electricity and supplies it to the main control board. Then the main control board supplies electricity in every floor Distribution board (D.B. board). Every distribution board has a main circuit breaker or more than one sub circuit breaker. Sub circuit breaker board confirms the correct electricity supply in the floor. 
- Two types of electricity supplies in the floor- a) 440volt, 50hertz & b) 220volt, 50hertz.
- Volt meter, Ammeter and Hertz meter have been attached in the main control board for ensuring correct electricity supply.

2. Correct electricity supply level assurance routine:
    - Electricity checkout on an every one hour later
    - Voltage, ampere, hertz, kilowatt and k.v.a. rating check.
3. Standard electricity supply level grading:
    - For three face: 880 volt, 50 hertz
    - For single face: 220 volt, 50 hertz
4. Required steps to be taken due to incorrect supply of electricity (if differences between ideal electricity value and getting electricity value):

Reasons for electricity supply level fluctuation and necessary steps 

<table><tbody><tr><td>Reasons behind electricity fluctuation&nbsp;</td><td>Necessary steps to be taken</td></tr><tr><td>Over voltage</td><td>To control electric voltage and hertz in the control board ensuring correct electricity supply from the generator.<br>If the electricity supplier is R.I.B., then inform the responsible authority of R.I.B. for any electric fluctuation problem.</td></tr><tr><td>Low voltage</td></tr><tr><td>Over frequency&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Low frequency</td></tr></tbody></table>
