### California Transparency Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)

Retailers and manufacturers must disclose on their websites, by Jan 1, 2012, the extent that they have done the following related to human trafficking & slavery in their supply chain:

1. Assess, verify, and address risks and identify if the verification is not conducted by a third party.

3. Audit suppliers to assess compliance with the company’s standards and identify if the verification did not involve an independent, unannounced audit.

5. Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with the relevant laws of the countries in which they are doing business.

7. Maintain internal accountability standards and  
    procedures for employees or contractors that do not meet the company’s standards.

9. Provide training on human trafficking & slavery and  
    how to mitigate related risks, to employees and  
    management who have direct responsibility for the supply chain management.

### TOOLS TO ADDRESS TRAFFICKING & FORCED LABOR

1. Code of Conduct on “Voluntary Labor”

3. Factory Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)

5. Supplier Audits against LF Codes & Standards

7. Training & Education on Human Trafficking & Forced Labor

### DETECTING AND ADDRESSING INSTANCES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING & FORCED LABOR

#### What do I do if I suspect human trafficking & forced labor is taking place?

**CHALLENGES TO DETECTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING & FORCED LABOR**

Human trafficking & forced labor are difficult to uncover

• Concrete evidence is often missing or hidden

• Victims are too frightened to speak out

• Non-physical methods of force are often used

- Hard to distinguish forced actions from voluntary actions  
    (For example, how do we know when a worker has chosen to work overtime,  
    versus been forced to?)

**ACTIONS WHEN HUMAN TRAFFICKING & FORCED LABOR IS SUSPECTED**

What to do if you suspect human trafficking & forced labor is taking  
place?

• **DO NOT** attempt to take matters into your own hands!  
– You may compromise any evidence and drive the offenders away, thereby making  
follow-up investigations difficult or impossible

• **DO** contact the Vendor Compliance department immediately so that  
appropriate investigations can be conducted

## SUMMARY

• Our supply chain strategy is guided by the Company Code of Conduct  
• Company must adhere to the Transparency in Supply Chains Act as of January 2012  
• Human trafficking and forced labor are difficult to define and detect  
• Company’s supply chain includes countries at risk for human trafficking and forced labor  
• Conditions for human trafficking and forced labor are driven more by development context than geography  
• If you suspect human trafficking & forced labor is occurring, contact the Vendor Compliance team  
• Company is addressing risks within its supply chain and your contribution is needed and invaluable!
